# CCCC native product

CCCC coordinates coding agents as a persistent group with shared messages,
delivery tracking, runtime state, a Web UI, and MCP access.

## Recommended end-user installation

Use the website installer for the normal end-user path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chesterra.github.io/cccc/install.sh | sh
```

Install the same native executable through pip on supported platforms:

```bash
python -m pip install -U "cccc-pair>=0.4.36"
```

Windows CMD or PowerShell uses `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; Invoke-RestMethod 'https://chesterra.github.io/cccc/install.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"`.
The website installers download a checksum-verified GitHub Release binary and
require neither Rust nor Python. The pip channel requires pip for installation,
but its native wheel contains the same executable and no CCCC Python runtime.
Do not install this crate with Cargo for normal product use. Upgrade a
website-installer distribution with:

```bash
cccc update
```

Use `cccc update --check` to query the latest channel release and display the
installation owner and platform requirements. It also works for pip-owned or
unmanaged executables without allowing self-update. Add `--offline` to inspect
local details without a network request. Pip-owned installations must be upgraded with
`python -m pip install --upgrade "cccc-pair>=0.4.36"`; `cccc update` refuses to
replace them through the standalone installer. The installer refuses to
overwrite an existing public `cccc` command without its standalone ownership
marker. A `pip-v1` marker is never overridden, even with
`CCCC_ALLOW_REPLACE_EXISTING=1`; uninstall `cccc-pair` with pip before changing
that command directory to the website installer.
Commands in other directories are preserved. The default installer moves its
directory to the front of the user PATH and reports remaining duplicates; verify
the selected command in a new terminal with `cccc doctor`.

## Workspace development

CCCC requires Rust 1.88 or newer. From the repository, run and test this
implementation directly with:

```bash
cargo run --locked --features standalone -p cccc --bin cccc -- --version
cargo test --locked --features standalone -p cccc
```

Web Model and NotebookLM browser projection require a locally installed Chrome,
Chromium, or Microsoft Edge browser. The core CLI, daemon, MCP server, and Web UI
do not require a browser.

Internal implementation crates use the `cccc-pair-*` namespace and are not
intended to be installed directly. Manual standalone workflow runs verify release
candidates. A matching release tag publishes the verified native artifacts to
GitHub Releases and the platform wheels to the configured Python package index.
