# Contributor Quality Gates

CCCC keeps the product implementation native while using small Python scripts
only for release packaging and repository-contract checks. Pull requests cover
source correctness; slower native-distribution checks run nightly and again on
the exact release artifacts.

## Local Commands

Run the impacted gate while developing:

```bash
scripts/quality_gate.sh fast
```

It selects checks from changed files:

- Rust changes run formatting plus focused Clippy/tests for the affected crates.
- Rust integration-test changes run their owning test binary; modules under
  `tests/suite/` map to the crate's `integration` target.
- Web changes run format, lint, and TypeScript checks.
- Release scripts, repository tests, workflows, and contract documentation run
  the small Python tooling suite. This suite does not import or launch a CCCC
  Python product implementation.

Local Cargo checks default to two build jobs to reduce memory pressure. Override
the bound on machines with more memory:

```bash
CCCC_CARGO_JOBS=4 scripts/quality_gate.sh fast
```

Inspect selection without running it:

```bash
scripts/pre_commit_checks.sh --dry-run
```

The impacted gate reports elapsed time against a 120-second feedback target.
Override the reporting threshold with `CCCC_PRECOMMIT_BUDGET_SECONDS`. A warning
does not hide a successful check.

Before handing off a broad change, run:

```bash
scripts/quality_gate.sh full
```

Full mode adds all Web tests, a production Web build, every release-tool and
repository-contract test, and the full Rust pre-commit scope.

Individual commands remain available:

```bash
npm -C web run check
npm -C web test
npm -C web run build
uvx ruff check scripts tests
uv run --no-project --with pytest --with pyyaml python -m pytest -q
```

## Web Toolchain

Install the locked Web dependencies and invoke tools through npm so they resolve
the project-local Vite+ binaries:

```bash
npm ci --prefix web
npm -C web run check
```

The native product embeds `web/dist`. `npm -C web run build` is sufficient before
rebuilding the Rust executable; `scripts/build_web.sh` and
`scripts/build_web.ps1` are convenience wrappers. `./scripts/build_package.sh`
builds both the frontend and the native archive. Restart the running CCCC process
with the resulting executable to load the new embedded UI.

The Web build script tracks inputs and exports its asset directory relative to
the current Rust package. This also applies when checkouts share a Cargo target
directory. `tests/test_web_build_paths.py` runs real Cargo builds across two
checkouts, including frontend-only updates and packaged assets. For release
verification, compare the new executable's HTTP-served `/ui/index.html` and
`/ui/assets/` files with the intended `web/dist`; a successful frontend build
alone does not prove which assets the executable contains.

CI pins Node 24.19.0. `npm run check` runs Vite+ Oxfmt/Oxlint followed by the
independent TypeScript 5.9 `tsc --noEmit` check. Type-aware Vite+ checks remain
disabled until their diagnostics and supported scope match this project.

## Connect Browser Acceptance

For changes to account linkage, embedded workbenches or Group connections, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_connect_browser.py
```

Check out `cccc-homepage` beside this repository and install its account
fixture dependencies (`npm ci --prefix ../cccc-homepage/account`) as well as
`web` dependencies first. The Linux runner requires Rust, Node/npm, Python 3.11+,
OpenSSL and Google Chrome. It builds current Web/CLI/test artifacts and exercises
both the native workbench and cross-member Group connection journeys. Its output
records both Git revisions, dirty-worktree status and the CLI digest.
`--journey workbench` or `--journey groups` runs only the selected journey.
The workbench journey observes the native shared event WebSocket: all three
subscriptions, headless snapshots, live ledger delivery and frame-bound resource
URLs. It also verifies that revocation closes independent event and terminal
sockets, rather than relying only on the UI to unmount them.

This is an explicit cross-repository acceptance gate, not part of every fast
check. It uses temporary Homes, local account databases, fixture Actors and a
separate browser. It does not use the production account service or paid
Providers. Passing it does not establish Cloudflare, WAN or native Windows/macOS
acceptance; those remain deployment/release checks.

## Pull-Request Jobs

| Job | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `quality` | Ruff plus release-tool, workflow, documentation, and packaging contract tests |
| `web` | Vite+ checks, TypeScript, all Web tests, and the production bundle |
| `package` | Deterministic native wheel/archive tooling and exact Rust-only wheel layout checks |
| `rust-linux` | Rust formatting, workspace Clippy/tests, Unix installer contracts, and serial combined-process lifecycle coverage |
| `windows-smoke` | Focused native Windows process-lifecycle checks |
| `ci-required` | Stable branch-protection aggregate; fails when any required job fails or is skipped |

The Rust job installs no Python product runtime. Its formatting, linting, tests,
and lifecycle checks reuse one checkout and Cargo target directory. Combined
daemon/Web process tests run last with one test thread to avoid lifecycle races.

Python in `quality` and `package` is a build/test interpreter only. There is no
Python daemon job, engine matrix, or cross-engine interoperability job.

## Nightly Native Verification

| Job | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `web-bundle` | Build the exact frontend embedded by native artifacts |
| `rust-dist` | Release-build the Rust workspace and run Unix installation/replacement smoke |
| `windows-installer` | Build the native Windows CLI and verify installer ownership and PATH handling |

`rust-dist` runs `scripts/tests/smoke_rust_replacement.sh` against the built
executable in a fresh `CCCC_HOME`. It verifies daemon lifecycle, a scoped Web
Model actor, MCP initialization, a real `cccc_code_exec` cell, and clean stop.

Release verification repeats installation and same-version replacement against
the exact Linux, Apple Silicon macOS, and Windows artifacts. Linux artifacts
must satisfy the manylinux 2.28 dependency boundary; the macOS artifact declares
macOS 11.0; Windows builds target Server 2022. Publication requires three native
wheels, three standalone archives, matching executable hashes, checksums,
version-bound installers, release notes, installed CLI/MCP/daemon/Web smoke, and
platform installer verification. Each wheel must also carry `pip-v1` in the
shared ownership marker path, replace any stale standalone marker on install,
refuse standalone self-update, and remove both its executable and marker on pip
uninstall.

The release workflow packages the same native executable bytes into standalone
archives and dependency-free platform wheels. It does not build an sdist,
universal wheel, importable CCCC Python package, fallback engine, or second Rust
registry distribution.

The Pages build uses its workflow token to resolve complete stable/RC releases,
then publishes `releases.json` alongside the stable-pinned installers. It must
fail before deployment if resolution fails or VitePress does not preserve that
index. For the first rollout, deploy Pages and verify
`https://chesterra.github.io/cccc/releases.json` before distributing the CLI that
uses it. Subsequent successful release workflows refresh Pages automatically;
`Deploy Docs` can also be rerun manually. Older clients blocked by API rate
limits can upgrade through the original installation command after the fixed
release is published. Installation and checksum verification remain unchanged.

## Design Boundary

- Formatting, linting, type checks, tests, and builds validate the current tree.
- Historical migration verifiers do not become permanent product dependencies.
- File length is a review signal, not a proxy for architecture quality. Refactor
  when cohesion, ownership, testing, or change risk provides concrete evidence.
