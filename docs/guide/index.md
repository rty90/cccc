# Guide

CCCC coordinates coding agents as a durable group chat: messages are routed, read state is visible, operations are controlled through one daemon, and the same group can be reached from Web UI, CLI, MCP, and IM bridges.

## Core Concepts (Short Version)

- **Working Group**: the collaboration unit with durable history
- **Actor**: an agent runtime session (foreman/peer)
- **Scope**: a directory context attached to a group
- **Ledger**: append-only collaboration event stream
- **Daemon**: single writer and source of operational truth
- **CCCC Connect**: same-account collaboration with independent instance state
