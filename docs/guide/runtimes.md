# Supported Runtimes

CCCC can run multiple agent runtimes in the same working group. Each actor chooses one runtime, while the daemon keeps messaging, delivery tracking, tasks, context, and Web/IM control in one shared CCCC group.

Use `cccc runtime list --all` to see the full supported list on your machine, and `cccc doctor` to check which CLI runtimes are installed.

## First-Class Runtimes

| Runtime | Runtime id | Entrypoint / surface | MCP setup |
|---------|------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `claude` | `claude` | Auto |
| Cline CLI | `cline` | `cline` | Auto |
| Codex CLI | `codex` | `codex` | Auto |
| DeepSeek Harness | `deepseek` | CCCC-managed `dsh-acp-demo` (headless ACP) | Automatic on first start; explicit setup remains available |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `copilot` | `copilot` | Auto |
| Cursor CLI | `cursor` | `cursor-agent` | Prompt-assisted |
| Devin CLI | `devin` | `devin` | Auto |
| Kiro CLI | `kiro` | `kiro-cli` | Auto |
| Kilo Code CLI | `kilo` | `kilo` | Prompt-assisted |
| Antigravity CLI | `antigravity` | `agy` | Prompt-assisted |
| Droid CLI | `droid` | `droid` | Auto |
| Amp | `amp` | `amp` | Auto |
| Auggie (Augment) | `auggie` | `auggie` | Auto |
| Grok Build | `grok` | CCCC-managed Grok leader + ACP + native TUI | Injected into each managed session |
| Hermes Agent | `hermes` | `hermes` | Auto through the user's Hermes profile |
| Kimi CLI | `kimi` | `kimi` | Auto |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | CCCC-managed ACP + authenticated native TUI attach | Injected into each managed session |
| ChatGPT Web Model | `web_model` | Bound ChatGPT Web conversation | Browser delivery + remote MCP connector |

`custom` is also supported as a manual fallback for any command-line agent that can be launched by CCCC.

## Autonomy Defaults

CCCC applies runtime-specific launch defaults for actors it starts. These defaults are intended to keep agent sessions moving without repeated approval prompts, while still leaving actor/profile commands editable in the Web settings.

| Runtime id | Default command | Permission / autonomy behavior |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `claude` | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skips Claude Code permission prompts. |
| `cline` | `cline --tui --auto-approve true` | Opens Cline's interactive TUI and enables tool auto-approval. |
| `codex` | `codex -c check_for_update_on_startup=false -c shell_environment_policy.inherit=all --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --search` | Bypasses Codex approvals/sandbox and preserves actor environment inheritance for MCP subprocesses. |
| `deepseek` | CCCC-managed `dsh-acp-demo --config …/cordis.yml` | Official ACP app composition; provider permission requests are rejected rather than implicitly approved. |
| `copilot` | `copilot --allow-all` | Allows Copilot CLI tool execution without per-action approval. |
| `cursor` | `cursor-agent --yolo --approve-mcps` | Uses Cursor YOLO mode and approves MCP usage. |
| `devin` | `devin --permission-mode dangerous` | Uses Devin's dangerous permission mode. |
| `kiro` | `kiro-cli chat --trust-all-tools` | Trusts Kiro tools for the session. |
| `antigravity` | `agy --dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skips Antigravity tool permission prompts. |
| `droid` | `droid --auto high` | Starts Droid in high-autonomy mode. |
| `grok` | `grok --always-approve` | Starts Grok Build with approval prompts bypassed. |
| `hermes` | `hermes --tui --yolo` | Starts Hermes in TUI YOLO mode. |
| `kimi` | `kimi --yolo` | Starts Kimi in YOLO mode. |
| `opencode` | `opencode --auto` | CCCC owns the ACP permission boundary and selects only request-scoped one-time approval; it never writes a persistent provider approval. |
| `amp` | `amp` | No extra CCCC launch flag; Amp's current CLI default is already direct tool execution. |
| `auggie` | `auggie` | Use Auggie permissions or settings for per-tool approval policy; CCCC does not inject a broad wildcard permission rule. |
| `kilo` | `kilo` | Use Kilo's `kilo.jsonc` permission settings or Auto Approve UI for broad approval policy. |
| `web_model` | N/A | Browser-delivered runtime; local CLI launch flags do not apply. |
| `custom` | User command | CCCC preserves the user-provided command exactly. |

CCCC 启动的 Codex 默认关闭启动更新检查，避免交互式升级菜单阻塞会话或消费待投递的消息。托管 app-server 与原生终端使用同一默认值，包括自定义可执行路径。CLI 升级仍由操作者通过原安装渠道管理；不修改全局 `config.toml`。需要恢复检查时，可在 Actor 或 Runtime Profile 的命令中显式添加 `-c check_for_update_on_startup=true`。这不解决不兼容版本或失效登录。

## Setup Commands

Most CLI runtimes can be prepared with `cccc setup --runtime <id>`:

```bash
cccc setup --runtime claude
cccc setup --runtime cline
cccc setup --runtime codex
cccc setup --runtime deepseek
cccc setup --runtime copilot
cccc setup --runtime devin
cccc setup --runtime kiro
cccc setup --runtime droid
cccc setup --runtime amp
cccc setup --runtime auggie
cccc setup --runtime grok
cccc setup --runtime hermes
cccc setup --runtime kimi
cccc setup --runtime opencode
```

DeepSeek Harness is an upstream developer preview, so CCCC owns and isolates the tested ACP composition. On first use, it installs only the four required packages (`dsh-acp`, `dsh-mcp-client`, `dsh-acp-demo`, and `dsh-llm-deepseek`) under `CCCC_HOME/runtimes/deepseek/<release>`. Exact direct versions plus an npm release cutoff keep every transitive `@deepseek-ai/dsh*` package on the same validated preview release. The managed LLM adapter caps output at 65,536 tokens so prompt and MCP tool context retain headroom inside the model window. Setup also prunes the obsolete direct `dsh` bundle and its managed profile patch from earlier preview installs. CCCC does not modify `~/.dsh` or a project `package.json`; the legacy one-shot `dsh --profile cccc-acp` path and its unused bundle profile are not used. Concurrent starts share one setup lock, and a failed installation remains retryable. Running `cccc setup --runtime deepseek` performs the same idempotent setup eagerly. Provider credentials such as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` remain deployment inputs and are never generated or persisted by setup.

Prompt-assisted runtimes print an idempotent setup prompt or contract that you run inside that runtime:

```bash
cccc setup --runtime cursor
cccc setup --runtime kilo
cccc setup --runtime antigravity
```

For a custom runtime, provide the command when creating or editing the actor:

```bash
cccc actor add worker --runtime custom --command "my-agent --with-flags"
```

## Runner Modes

Actors normally run in one of two modes:

- **PTY**: the runtime runs in an embedded terminal. This is the broadest compatibility mode.
- **Headless**: CCCC manages structured runtime I/O without a terminal. This gives tighter delivery and streaming control where supported.

Claude Code, Codex CLI, Grok Build, and OpenCode support both PTY and headless operation. DeepSeek Harness is fixed to headless ACP operation. Most other CLI runtimes, including Cline, use PTY. ChatGPT Web Model is fixed to browser delivery plus a remote MCP connector.

Cline is currently integrated as a fresh-start PTY runtime. CCCC does not persist or reuse Cline's `--id` session identifier, so stopping and starting a Cline actor opens a new Cline TUI session.

### PTY delivery and recovery

A successful Send means that CCCC durably appended the message and attempted a
runtime handoff; it does not prove that the provider application understood or
acted on the text. For each concrete recipient, `runtime.delivery` records
`claimed` before external I/O and then `accepted`, `failed`, or `ambiguous`.
Concurrent claimants treat `claimed` as in progress. On daemon restart, a claim
without an outcome is settled to `ambiguous` and is not retried automatically.

Current-generation Send work with no accepted/ambiguous evidence can be
recovered in ledger order after actor/group activation. Mail is never promoted
by recovery: it remains in the Inbox until `cccc_inbox_read`, apart from the
single bounded content-free Mail notice. Within the current actor generation,
legacy `chat.read.event_id` remains an inclusive ledger watermark rather than a
per-event receipt. Recovery excludes `system.notify` records at or before the
furthest valid watermark, plus later notices that reference an event in that
read prefix, so an upgrade cannot replay old unread nudges into a new provider
session. Runtime handoff never advances the Inbox cursor.
Restarting a provider process does not transfer its input mode, preamble memory,
or hot terminal ring; durable ledger, Mail cursor, reply-obligation, and
runtime-delivery facts remain the recovery authority.

Daemon startup does not count as Actor work and never submits a synthetic model
turn. CCCC reconnects a validated managed session where possible, and a provider
that can open its terminal without model work may start idle. A fresh managed PTY
whose native terminal requires a materialized provider turn remains dormant until
an explicit start or a real pending Send wakes it; a restored headless worker
stays idle. The first real delivery to a successfully restored worker also
carries its pending CCCC startup instructions, in the same provider turn rather
than through a separate bootstrap request.

### Managed Codex/Grok/OpenCode sessions and Claude PTY Hook State

For a command whose executable is directly identified as Codex, PTY and
Headless share one daemon-owned app-server session implementation for
structured Codex turns. Unsupported subcommands or prompt tails fail explicitly
instead of selecting another Codex transport. PTY
is only a presentation choice: CCCC additionally opens Codex's remote TUI
against the exact hosted thread, while Headless omits that terminal. The
app-server and TUI receive the same executable, model, Codex Profile, supported
`-c` overrides, YOLO policy, and private environment; only the host receives
the actor-scoped CCCC MCP and listener arguments. Provider events, rather than
terminal text, are the working-state and completion authority. Stop/start
resumes the same validated thread, while `actor new-session` deliberately
creates a new one. Voice Analyst uses this same Codex host/remote-TUI substrate,
with a global user MCP identity and its own warm lifecycle instead of Actor
identity and Group lifecycle.

Direct Grok Actors use the same managed-session contract through Grok's native
topology: CCCC owns one private leader, connects an ACP controller, and attaches
the native writable Grok TUI to the exact same provider session for PTY mode.
Headless mode omits only that TUI. Structured ACP events own delivery, progress,
completion, cancellation, and working state; terminal text is never scraped as
protocol. CCCC injects the actor-scoped MCP server into the session rather than
changing Grok's global MCP registry. Stop/start validates and loads the version-2
managed receipt, while `actor new-session` deliberately replaces it. Grok
subcommands, wrappers, prompt tails, and user-owned leader/session flags fail
explicitly; there is no raw-PTY fallback beside the managed path.

Direct OpenCode Actors require OpenCode 1.18.14 or newer. They use one
`opencode acp` process as both the structured controller endpoint and an
authenticated loopback backend. CCCC injects the
actor-scoped MCP server when it creates or loads the ACP session. PTY attaches
OpenCode's native writable TUI to that exact backend and session; Headless omits
only the TUI. CCCC observes authenticated `session.status` events for native-TUI
turn ownership, so a terminal turn blocks queued delivery until it settles.
Losing that non-replayable lifecycle stream invalidates the session rather than
guessing that it is idle. Stop/start validates and loads a version-2 OpenCode
receipt; `actor new-session` deliberately replaces it. CCCC owns ACP/server,
session, attach, cwd, MCP, and permission arguments. It accepts documented
model, agent, pure-mode, and logging options, but subcommands, wrappers, prompt
tails, and user-owned topology/session flags fail explicitly with no raw-PTY
fallback. OpenCode does not emit the accepted user prompt through ACP, so CCCC
correlates the same user message and exact prompt on OpenCode's authenticated
backend event stream before acknowledging admission. Pre-admission ACP updates
remain bounded and are released only after that match; busy rejections discard
the buffer and remain retryable.
For supported OpenCode releases, the prompt response is the exact completion
fence; older releases are rejected instead of being hidden behind timing-based
output recovery. Grok retains its explicit bounded post-response normalization.

An arbitrary wrapper that cannot be transformed into a Codex app-server
without changing its meaning remains an explicit direct-PTY or headless-stdio
compatibility path. On that path, Codex activity comes from lifecycle hooks injected only
into processes that CCCC starts: prompt and tool events report `working`,
permission requests report `waiting`, and verified stop/session events report
`idle` or `stopped`. CCCC registers only events in the current
[Codex Hooks contract](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks). Every
injected hook process carries a per-launch fence, and late events from an older
launch, session, turn, or operation cannot overwrite current state.

Turn and per-turn operation identity histories have a hard 4096-entry safety bound and never evict entries. Reaching a bound fails closed instead of making an old identity reusable: turn exhaustion revokes the active turn for the rest of that session, while operation exhaustion revokes operation writes for the current turn. The corresponding working-state reasons are `codex_hook_turn_fence_exhausted` and `codex_hook_operation_fence_exhausted`.

Claude PTY hooks do not provide one stable turn identifier across prompt, tool, permission, notification, and stop events. CCCC therefore treats them fail-closed: fenced `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` establish only the session boundary, normal `terminal_write` opens a local `working` generation, and Esc or Ctrl-C closes it to `idle`. Claude PTY prompt/tool/permission/notification/stop hooks cannot change working state, so permission `waiting` and automatic stop `idle` are intentionally not claimed as precise; `PostToolUseFailure` is still registered so the separate runtime-activity projection can close a failed tool instead of leaving it active. The API exposes this limitation through `effective_working_reason` values prefixed with `claude_pty_fail_closed_`. Claude headless sessions are unchanged and continue to use structured provider events for precise turn lifecycle.

The direct-hook compatibility path and Claude integration are session-only.
CCCC generates a new launch fence for every actual direct provider process and
passes it only through that process environment. Wrapper and alternate commands
are not mutated. CCCC does not write `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, or project
settings files, and sessions launched outside CCCC do not run the CCCC status
hook. Version 2 hook-state files remain readable for diagnostics but are
reported as `legacy_unfenced`; configuring a new direct launch replaces them
with a fenced version 3 pending state, and tokenless legacy events cannot unlock
it.

For the direct-hook Codex compatibility path, fenced `SessionStart` remains the
durable provider-session identity source and the terminal `/status` parser is a
delayed fallback. App-server-backed Codex PTY actors instead persist the
provider thread returned by the structured protocol; they never derive that
identity from terminal text.

Claude PTY hook state requires Claude Code 2.1.141 or newer, confirmed by a successful `--version` probe. Wrapper commands, alternate commands, failed probes, and older Claude versions remain on the prior PTY state source and are not mutated; their newly written unavailable baseline prevents a stale hook file from being treated as current. For an otherwise eligible direct command, a settings merge, hook executable, or spawn failure records a specific `HookUnavailable…` launch reason and fails closed instead of silently falling back to terminal-text inference. Enterprise policy, `disableAllHooks`, and safe/bare modes can still prevent a valid injected hook from running; that remains visible as a pending hook reason.

Version 3 hook state and version 1 runtime activity use the canonical
0.4.35-compatible paths, advisory locks, and committed-write protocol: flush
and sync the temporary file, atomically replace the destination, then sync the
parent directory where the platform supports it. Frozen-home migration tests
cover the retained state boundary. Never run two daemons against the same
`CCCC_HOME`.

The Rust daemon also owns the lifetime of every process-backed actor. On Windows, the daemon host and each PTY actor use non-breakaway Job Objects with `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`; Codex and actor-launched MCP descendants inherit containment when they are created, so an abrupt daemon or combined Web-process exit cannot leave them orphaned. On POSIX, each PTY actor is already a separate session and normal stop/reap terminates its entire process group. Process cleanup never removes `group.yaml`, `ledger.jsonl`, or retained `.pty` history.

Verified PTY hook events also feed the Web runtime activity ticker. This is a separate, short-lived observability channel rather than chat history: it carries only structured lifecycle fields, replays briefly after reconnects, and detects long-running turn or tool activity. See [PTY Runtime Activity](/guide/runtime-activity) for the event contract, retention, and privacy boundaries.

`runtime=codex|grok|opencode|claude|deepseek` with `runner=headless` starts a daemon-managed
provider process. Codex reuses the same app-server launch, thread, delivery, and
resume mechanics as Codex PTY but omits the remote TUI. Grok reuses its private
leader, ACP session, delivery, and resume mechanics while likewise omitting only
the TUI. OpenCode reuses its authenticated ACP backend, session, delivery, and
resume mechanics while omitting only `opencode attach`. Claude uses
bidirectional stream-json, and DeepSeek uses ACP NDJSON
through CCCC's fixed composition. Messages are delivered automatically, provider
health determines the actor's `running` value, and stopping the actor or group
terminates the provider process. Headless state comes from these structured
provider protocols rather than the PTY hooks.

DeepSeek ACP prompts are sent as `ContentBlock[]`. ACP agent-message chunks are
projected to `headless.message.delta` and `headless.message.completed`; turn
boundaries use `headless.turn.started` plus `headless.turn.completed` or
`headless.turn.failed`. This is the same durable event contract used by Web SSE
and reconnect snapshots. The daemon inherits its process environment, then
overlays actor/profile values, but forces the managed `DSH_HOME` into CCCC's
versioned runtime directory. ACP session data is isolated per actor at
`CCCC_HOME/groups/<group_id>/state/deepseek/<actor_id>/sessions`, never in the
attached project. Installation and provider turns each have a 300-second bound.
A timed-out turn is cancelled and recorded as failed only after its terminal
response; if confirmation cannot be obtained, the supervisor is stopped before
the source message remains eligible for retry. Missing credentials and
context-window overflow stop the current runtime and require a lifecycle
start/restart, preventing a permanently invalid request from entering a provider
retry loop. That gate is durable across daemon restarts; daemon restore and
message-triggered auto-wake leave it closed, while a successfully initialized
lifecycle start opens it for the replacement provider process. Existing large
Codex/Claude headless logs receive a one-time streaming dedupe-index migration
when DeepSeek first writes to them, without loading the full log into memory.

For daemon-managed Codex headless turns, a provider status of `failed`, `error`,
or `cancelled`, or an explicit provider error, is persisted as
`headless.turn.failed`; only a successful terminal notification is persisted as
`headless.turn.completed`. Acceptance has already advanced the actor's read
cursor, so a provider failure is not silently retried, but it does release the
session lane for later queued turns.

Daemon-managed Codex runs with non-interactive approval policy. If app-server
nevertheless sends a provider-initiated approval, user-input, elicitation, or
tool request, CCCC returns an explicit JSON-RPC unsupported-method error instead
of hanging the turn or approving it implicitly. Use the PTY runner when the
provider workflow requires interactive approval or input.

Daemon-managed Codex PTY and headless actors persist the app-server thread in
the runtime-session state. An ordinary actor stop/start resumes that exact thread
after validating the runtime, workspace, command, model, and saved-state
status. If the provider rejects the resume, CCCC records the failure and starts
a fresh thread. `actor_new_session` deliberately clears the saved thread first,
and `CCCC_RUNTIME_RESUME=0` disables this reuse globally.

Daemon-managed Claude headless actors use the same shared state boundary for
their explicit provider session. A fresh direct `claude` command receives a
CCCC-owned `--session-id`; a compatible ordinary stop/start uses `--resume`
with that same id after validating the runtime,
workspace, stable command, model, and saved-state status. Wrapper commands and
commands that already contain Claude session-control flags remain user-owned
and are not rewritten. `actor_new_session` clears the saved session, and
`CCCC_RUNTIME_RESUME=0` disables reuse. If the provider rejects a saved session
during startup, CCCC reports that start as failed and marks the id ineligible.
If a process survives startup but the first streamed result rejects that same
resume, CCCC records `headless.session.resume_failed`, marks the id ineligible,
and stops that provider session. The next start creates a fresh session rather
than retrying the dead id; CCCC does not hide either failure behind an automatic
retry.

`web_model` keeps the pull-consumer contract: an external executor calls
`cccc_runtime_wait_next_turn` and `cccc_runtime_complete_turn`. The daemon also
exposes this generic pull contract to programmatically configured
`custom+headless` actors; the standard Web actor editor does not currently
expose that combination. These actors do not claim to have a local provider
process.

For a running Antigravity PTY actor, `actor_new_session` submits the runtime's
native `/clear` command. This creates a new provider conversation while keeping
the authenticated process, project, and terminal sandbox alive. A stopped
Antigravity actor starts normally. Ordinary stop/start behavior remains
process-based and does not claim provider-session resume semantics.

## ChatGPT Web Model

`web_model` does not use `cccc setup`. Create the ChatGPT Web Model actor from the CCCC Web group, then finish sign-in, MCP URL setup, and conversation binding in **Settings > ChatGPT Web Model**.

This runtime works with ChatGPT Web sessions that can use the CCCC MCP connector.
Text-only **Standard** delivery remains the default. The explicitly experimental
**GPT Pro** mode attaches one tiny blank PNG to each delivered batch for accounts
where that ChatGPT-side behavior exposes the connector. CCCC does not select the
ChatGPT model and cannot guarantee that this compatibility workaround will keep
working when ChatGPT changes.

For details, see [ChatGPT Web Model Runtime](/guide/web-model-runtime).

## Choosing a Runtime

Use a mixed group when different agents are good at different roles:

- Use a Claude Code or Codex actor as the foreman when you want strong local coding orchestration.
- Add a second runtime as reviewer to diversify feedback.
- Use ChatGPT Web Model when you want a browser-backed GPT-5.x actor with CCCC MCP access.
- Use `custom` only when the runtime is not first-class yet or needs a special command.

Each actor can have its own runtime, command override, private environment, and runner mode. Runtime state stays in `CCCC_HOME`, not in your repository.

PTY terminal output always uses bounded memory and can optionally persist a bounded per-actor transcript. See [Terminal history](terminal-history.md) for opt-in persistence, retention, cursor, restart, and security behavior.

## Verification and Troubleshooting

```bash
cccc runtime list --all
cccc doctor
```

Common checks:

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Runtime is listed but unavailable | Install the CLI and make sure the command is on `PATH`. |
| MCP tools are missing in the runtime | Run `cccc setup --runtime <id>` or follow the prompt-assisted setup instructions. |
| Custom actor will not start | Ensure `--command` is set; CCCC cannot infer a command for `custom`. |
| Existing actor does not pick up setup changes | Restart the actor after setup or profile changes. |
| ChatGPT Web Model cannot call CCCC | Confirm the public HTTPS MCP URL, ChatGPT connector setup, and bound conversation. |

Before the Rust daemon creates an automatically managed PTY session or launches a supported local headless provider, it establishes the runtime's CCCC MCP path. Codex, Grok, and OpenCode receive an actor-scoped server inside their managed session; none of their global MCP registries is changed. Other automatically configured runtimes are checked against the active public CCCC executable: missing entries are installed, safely replaceable stale user/global entries are replaced, and the result is verified before the actor process starts. A failed check, repair, or verification prevents launch, including daemon restart recovery. A stale entry from a more specific project or non-user scope fails with an actionable error instead of being silently overwritten. Prompt-assisted runtimes (`cursor`, `kilo`, and `antigravity`) retain their startup setup contract, while indirect custom provider commands remain responsible for their own MCP configuration. `cccc setup --runtime grok` and `cccc setup --runtime opencode` therefore report session ownership instead of mutating provider-global configuration.

This preflight runs before the provider discovers its tools. It therefore repairs Python-to-Rust executable path changes without requiring a second restart. Sessions that were already running when an external MCP configuration changed still need to be restarted because provider tool catalogs are session-scoped.

### Cline installation

Cline's npm package loads a platform-specific optional package. If `cline --version` reports that the platform package is missing, verify that npm is using the official registry, then reinstall with optional dependencies enabled:

```bash
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm install -g cline --include=optional
cline --version
cccc setup --runtime cline
```

CCCC uses Cline's own noninteractive `mcp add` command and verifies the resulting `cline_mcp_settings.json`; it does not hand-edit Cline's configuration.

The Web UI also exposes runtime detection and actor configuration from the add/edit actor dialogs.
