# Voice Secretary

Voice Secretary runs in the native CCCC product and uses one durable workflow
authority. Local ASR is provided by the linked `sherpa-onnx` runtime.

Voice Secretary is a hidden internal actor backed by repository Markdown.
Enabling it copies the foreman's runtime settings into the dedicated
`voice-secretary` actor; disabling it removes only that actor and leaves
documents, transcript sidecars, and model caches intact.

On screens narrower than 640 px, the composer keeps the microphone and a
**Voice options** button in the action bar. Voice options contains capture mode,
language, prompt polishing, and the workspace entry in a scrollable panel with
44 px touch targets. Recording locks still disable mode and language changes. Desktop and mobile
language controls share the same disabled state, including pending saves;
completion or failure re-enables language selection.
Menus close when switching Groups, when their controls become unavailable, or
when responsive layout hides their trigger. Opening the workspace transfers
keyboard focus into it; closing it returns focus to the Voice options button.
Transcription and prompt-processing status appear above the input instead of
competing with action buttons. The wider-screen controls remain inline.

For an isolated browser regression, start a Vite dev server on port 15559 and run
`python3 web/tests/browser/voice-mobile.py` (see the script for configuration).
It checks production controls at 390×844, 844×390, and 1280×900 in English,
Chinese and Japanese, menu lifecycle and focus, and real xterm touch protocols.
It uses a temporary Chrome profile and synthetic HTTP, with no microphone,
provider or daemon calls. These checks do not replace iPhone Safari QA.

## Workspace modes

**Doc** keeps the document list, document/transcript view and recent activity
available together on desktop. **Ask** gives the request and its activity the
main workspace. **Prompt** shows the current composer text, its existing
optimization action and recent activity. Edit or send the text in the composer;
choosing Prompt from the mode selector returns there.

Open a linked document directly from Ask or Prompt activity, then use **Back to
activity** to return without changing the capture mode or recording target.
Doc also provides the full document list. Expanded Prompt controls and activity
remain scrollable on short screens. Switching views preserves the
unsaved document draft and typed Ask request; an unsaved-document notice remains
visible outside Doc. Recording still locks mode changes and keeps its original
target. Collapsing a section does not stop recording or background processing.

## External realtime ASR: Bailian and Volcengine

Select **Settings > Assistants > Recognition location > External provider ASR**.
Choose a provider, configure its credentials, save the provider configuration,
and then save the Group settings. Provider selection is Group-specific;
credentials/model settings are shared by this CCCC service instance and can only
be managed by administrators. Existing recordings retain the provider/model
selected at start; changes apply to subsequent recordings.

- **Alibaba Cloud Bailian**: API Key, Beijing or Singapore region, optional
  Workspace ID, and either `fun-asr-realtime` (default) or
  `paraformer-realtime-v2`. A Workspace ID selects the region's dedicated
  `maas.aliyuncs.com` endpoint; leaving it empty uses the supported DashScope
  endpoint for that region. API keys must match the selected region/workspace.
- **Volcengine Doubao**: the optimized bidirectional `bigmodel_async` endpoint.
  New-console accounts use **API Key**; legacy accounts use **App ID + Access
  Token**. Select the purchased 1.0/2.0 duration/concurrent Resource ID; the
  default is `volc.seedasr.sauc.duration`. Streaming language detection is owned
  by the Volcengine model; the local language selection is not sent as an
  unsupported forced-language parameter.

**Test connection** checks the saved credentials/connection (and Bailian task
admission) without sending microphone audio. It is not a recognition-accuracy
or available-quota guarantee. Real recognition requires an enabled, funded
provider account and network access from the CCCC server to the provider WSS
endpoint. Audio leaves the CCCC server for the chosen provider and may incur
provider charges.

Credentials are stored separately from Group/assistant configuration, in
`CCCC_HOME/config/voice-asr-providers.json`, using atomic owner-only writes on
Unix. Read APIs return presence/configured flags rather than credentials.
Blank credential inputs preserve the stored values; **Clear provider
credentials** explicitly removes them. Browser code never receives stored keys,
and vendor response bodies/credential headers are not relayed in errors.

External recording reuses the browser's 16 kHz mono PCM16 WebSocket transport,
recording lease and bounded segmented storage. Audio is packaged in 200 ms
chunks. Volcengine uses incremental (`single`) utterance results, which are
accumulated by timestamp instead of retransmitting the complete meeting on
every update. Bailian waits for `task-started` before audio; Volcengine's optimized
stream starts sending audio without waiting for a nonexistent task-started event.
Stopping flushes the remaining PCM, requests the provider's final result, and
waits for explicit completion before emitting the existing `final_asr_text` and
`closed` events. Empty captures close without submitting an empty recognition.

For document capture, the server buffers stable provider sentences and appends
them with idempotent IDs at the configured document-update interval. Disabling
automatic updates (`auto_document_max_window_seconds: null`) defers submission
until recording ends; live subtitles still arrive immediately. Stop and recovery
flush pending text regardless of the interval. The browser does not append
duplicate cloud checkpoints. Complete final results supersede live revisions
through the existing transcript API. Provider completion is separate from saving:
a failed last checkpoint is retried with its original segment ID, and the final
text is still returned with persistence status so the browser can retry saving.
If several segments remain unconfirmed, the browser retries those segments with
their original IDs before saving the final revision. This also recovers available
segments from an incomplete recording without treating them as a complete final
transcript. If a browser retry still fails, recording stops with an error and
the remaining unconfirmed text returns to the original Group's composer for
review; it is not automatically sent to an Actor.
Connection failures retain known document segments and recover available text to
the composer for non-document capture. A disconnected document recording gets a
bounded attempt to finalize its provider stream. Lease release is fenced to its
owner and also runs when the handler is cancelled.

This initial external integration is realtime WebSocket ASR. The existing HTTP
file-transcription endpoint remains local-ASR-only. Cloud capture does not invoke
local SenseVoice final ASR or local speaker separation. Provider session/quota
limits can be stricter than local recording limits; failures stop capture
explicitly rather than silently reconnecting/replaying billable audio.

## Local ASR

Open **Settings > Assistants**, enable Voice Secretary, select **Local ASR**, and
install the final and live models. The sherpa-onnx runtime is linked into the
Rust binary, so runtime install/remove actions are compatibility no-ops. Models
are downloaded into `~/.cccc/cache/voice-models`, verified against the bundled
manifest, unpacked in staging, and atomically activated. Existing model caches
and `install-state.json` files are read in place. Operating-system file locks
make interrupted installs recoverable after a process crash.

Live browser capture sends 16 kHz mono PCM16 as binary WebSocket frames; JSON is
used only for start/stop control messages. Both WebSocket recordings and HTTP
binary request bodies are streamed into auto-deleted files under `~/.cccc/cache`
instead of being accumulated in Rust byte buffers. Short WebSocket recordings
receive immediate final ASR. When speaker analysis is available, persistent
recordings over 30 seconds, or recordings stopped while the single native
inference worker is occupied, complete stop promptly, retain the durable live
transcript, and defer final speaker-labeled transcription to the queued
speaker-analysis stage. Final ASR paths that cannot
defer reuse one offline recognizer across bounded 30-second inference ranges.
HTTP uploads keep their fail-fast busy response. The 100 MiB value is a per-recording abuse and
resource limit (about 55 minutes of PCM16), not a preallocated memory requirement.
Each WebSocket recording must also hold the daemon recording lease.

### Switching Groups During Recording

An active recording is a navigation-independent session. Its Group, target
document, capture mode, dispatch target, composer snapshot, and session ID are
fixed when recording starts. Switching the visible Group does not move or stop
the recording: checkpoints, final transcripts, Ask/Prompt requests, and speaker
analysis continue to target the original Group. The UI identifies that Group
and keeps the single global recording lease until the user stops and saves.

Direct-composer results follow the same ownership rule. If another Group is
visible when text becomes ready, CCCC appends it to the original Group's
preserved composer draft instead of changing the visible Group's draft.
The live recognizer resets its native stream at every detected speech endpoint,
including silence or unchanged hypotheses, so decoded features do not accumulate
for the lifetime of an open microphone connection.

WebSocket PCM is rolled into a new file every 25 minutes (48,000,000 bytes). A
completed segment is flushed and data-synced before the server emits
`recording_segment_saved`; capture and live recognition continue without
reopening the microphone. Clean completion removes the temporary files after
the final pipeline releases them. The complete WebSocket session is capped at
800 MiB (about 7 hours 17 minutes) as an abuse and disk guard. HTTP uploads keep
their independent 100 MiB limit. Browser-side backpressure keeps a bounded PCM
tail and sends it before the stop frame; if audio must be dropped, capture stops
with an explicit error instead of silently shifting transcript timestamps.
Final result metadata reports each 30-second inference range in timeline order
and retains its owning 25-minute `recording_segment_index`.

The linked Rust speech runtime and an installed live streaming model are
separate readiness conditions: the microphone control is service-ready only
when a compatible streaming model is installed (or an explicit test mock is
configured). Runtime linkage alone must not defer a predictable missing-model
failure until after recording starts.
Disconnects finalize the last hypothesis. Stopping capture releases the
microphone immediately, runs the installed SenseVoice model on the blocking
worker pool, and sends `final_asr_text` before closing the recording connection.
For document capture, successful complete final ASR is also stored as a `final`
revision that supersedes the session's `live` checkpoints. The meeting view therefore
replaces the low-latency **Live Paraformer** cards with the higher-quality
**Final SenseVoice** result after stop or reconnect, while the raw live rows
remain in transcript sidecars for recovery and audit. The daemon atomically
deduplicates this revision against existing live semantic input; a short
recording with no live input uses the final revision as its one document input
when automatic document input is enabled.
Partial final ASR never supersedes the complete live transcript. If no live text
exists, its successful partial text remains the fallback. If final persistence
fails, the WebSocket reports that state and the browser retries the idempotent
revision before falling back to its retained transcript. If final ASR fails,
the live transcript remains available. For segmented
recordings, successful segment text is retained, while any failed segment is
reported explicitly as a partial final transcript in the Web UI. An installed
diarization model then adds speaker ranges in the background and emits an
`assistant.voice.session` event when the result is ready.
Speaker ranges are normalized to first-seen `Speaker 1..N` labels, tiny
spurious clusters are absorbed into the nearest stable speaker, and adjacent
same-speaker windows are merged within bounded durations. One offline
recognizer is then reused to transcribe each speaker window independently. The
complete sorted speaker timeline is retained; processing does not discard turns
after a fixed segment count. The
meeting view therefore restores per-speaker text instead of assigning one
whole-recording transcript to whichever range contains its midpoint.
Speaker identities are never synthesized by this post-processing: ranges and
labels are published only after the native pyannote + 3D-Speaker clustering
pipeline succeeds. A clustering or per-window ASR failure is reported as
`diarization_failed`, and the saved raw transcript remains unlabeled.
An unexpected WebSocket disconnect also flushes the owned temporary recording,
runs final ASR, and durably appends the best available final transcript for
document capture before starting speaker separation. Prompt, instruction, and
direct-composer capture never create meeting artifacts or speaker-analysis jobs.
The connection releases its recording lease only when the stored owner and lease
ID still match, so stale connection cleanup cannot unlock a newer recorder.
Reacquiring from the same browser owner also creates a fresh lease ID and fences
the superseded connection.
Only one native inference job runs at a time. The sherpa-onnx diarization API
requires one complete `f32` waveform, so this stage has a bounded, temporary
full-recording memory peak; it reads directly from the recording file without
also retaining a duplicate PCM byte buffer. Speaker analysis waits fairly behind
active final ASR or speaker work and persists its result when the worker becomes
available; only a missing model skips analysis. Every recording has an
independent session ID, so a late result cannot overwrite a newer recording.

## Durable Input

Stable document-capture ASR segments are appended to:

```text
~/.cccc/voice-secretary/<group_id>/<session_id>/transcripts/segments.jsonl
```

The bounded per-session meeting projection is shared in
`groups/<group_id>/state/assistants.json`. The durable document-level transcript
that survives session pruning and aggregates several recordings is shared at
`~/.cccc/voice-secretary/<group_id>/documents/<document_id>/transcript.jsonl`.
Both Web implementations read these records through the daemon instead of
owning a separate browser-side transcript authority. Transcript clearing also
uses the daemon operation so the session projection and both durable logs are
removed under the same transcript lock.

Each stored segment declares a transcript stage when the producer knows it:
`live` for incremental Paraformer checkpoints and `final` for a complete stopped
SenseVoice pass. A final revision records the live segment IDs it supersedes.
Consumers project the non-superseded records, but storage keeps both stages;
this is raw/final revision history, not destructive replacement. General LLM
punctuation, filler removal, and prose polishing are not part of this path.

Prompt refinement and document instructions are semantic inputs, not meeting
transcripts: they never create a session entry or a per-session transcript
sidecar. Semantic input is appended to the daemon-owned durable input log before
the daemon writes the corresponding ledger event and targeted `system.notify`.
Segment identity is independent from the prompt request ID: one prompt request
may accumulate several speech appends, while each append carries its own
`input_append_id`. Retrying the same append reuses that ID and does not duplicate
input or invalidate a pending draft; later speech keeps the request ID but uses a
new append ID. The internal actor reads unread batches through
`cccc_voice_secretary_document`, edits the
repository document, and the daemon reconciles the Markdown content into the
document index when assistants or documents are next read or selected. A changed
file advances the indexed revision once; repeated reads are idempotent.
The durable input log remains the idempotency source after the bounded session
preview is trimmed, and interrupted ledger notification is completed on retry.
Archived documents are retained in durable state but omitted from the working
document projection. Archiving the current document selects the most recently
updated remaining active document, or clears the active target when none remain.

Only the `voice-secretary` actor may advance the unread input cursor. Document
paths must be repository-relative Markdown paths; symbolic-link components are
rejected so the document API cannot write outside the selected workspace.

Prompt mode uses two distinct operations. Web input first calls
`assistant_voice_input_append(kind="prompt_refine")`, which records the current
composer text, speech, operation, request ID, and composer snapshot before
delivering one canonical input envelope. The actor then returns the optimized
text through
`cccc_voice_secretary_composer(action="submit_prompt_draft")`, which maps to
`assistant_voice_prompt_draft_submit`. Draft submission updates only the
existing request; it never appends another Voice Secretary input. Empty or
non-substantive refinements use `no_op=true`.

Instruction/Ask mode creates a durable pending `ask_requests` item in the same
accepted daemon operation as its semantic input, before actor delivery. The
delivered notification renders an explicit work
order with the target, request ID, and required MCP output instead of relying on
the actor to infer routing from raw JSON. User-visible answers must be submitted
through `cccc_voice_secretary_request(action="report")`; ordinary console text
is not treated as a delivered reply. A report updates the Ask item, emits an
`assistant.voice.request` ledger event, and lets the web client restore
`reply_text` after refresh or reconnect. Exact input and report retries are
idempotent.

When Voice Secretary is disabled, microphone input remains available as direct
dictation. Local ASR accepts the explicit `composer` dispatch target, but the
browser appends the transcript straight to the composer
without creating a secretary input, running prompt refinement, updating a
document, persisting a secretary session, or starting speaker diarization.
Composer acquisition and heartbeats remain valid while Voice Secretary is
disabled; a heartbeat that omits its dispatch target inherits `composer` from
the matching active lease.

An active local-ASR audio stream renews its recording lease. The browser's
HTTP heartbeat remains a cross-tab status signal, but transient heartbeat
failures do not stop or orphan an otherwise healthy recording WebSocket. The
explicit single-recorder lease remains authoritative.

After a successful local-ASR stop, the server sends the final transcript events,
the application `closed` event, and a WebSocket Close frame with code 1000.
The browser processes transport errors after earlier transcript events so that
expected shutdown cannot interrupt asynchronous transcript finalization or
display a spurious connection-failed message. Unexpected connection failures
still report an error.

Documents use the active workspace under `docs/voice-secretary/`. Groups without
an active workspace store the Markdown fallback under CCCC_HOME. Removing a
model, disabling the assistant, or restarting CCCC does not delete documents or
raw transcript sidecars.

Voice Secretary has one durable authority for lifecycle, durable health,
sessions, prompt drafts/requests, and ask requests:
`groups/<group_id>/state/assistants.json`. Assistant enablement and configuration
remain in `group.yaml`; process-local PID, port, service, and socket observations
are rebuilt after startup. Former preview input/document projection fields are
preserved under `rust_state` rather than being mistaken for common workflow
records. Every recording-lease mutation and expiry-capable read is serialized
through `~/.cccc/state/voice_secretary_recording_lease.json.lock`, so concurrent
clients cannot silently create a second recorder. Repository Markdown,
transcript/input sidecars, the shared document index, and native model caches
retain their specialized stores.

Native model installation is a Web-owned boundary: the Web UI manages the
bundled sherpa-onnx model cache, while the daemon reports
`assistant_voice_model_install=false` in daemon capabilities. Callers must
inspect that capability instead of assuming a daemon operation is available.

### Recognition settings save automatically

Recognition backend, external provider, and document update switches save when changed.
The document interval saves when the input loses focus or Enter is pressed. Failed
saves show an error and restore the previous settings. These group configuration
updates do not start the Voice Secretary actor; only an explicit enable request
starts it. Provider credentials still use their separate save action. Changes to
recognition settings apply to the next recording.

New Volcengine configurations default to API Key authentication and ASR 2.0 hourly.
Existing credentials, authentication modes, and resource versions are preserved.
Choose credentials by their field names in the speech console, not by the age of
an account: API Key and App ID + Access Token are separate authentication methods.
Secret Key is not used by this streaming API. The selected model version and
billing plan must be enabled for that account. Connection tests distinguish a
known resource-not-granted rejection from authentication failure, unspecified
access denial, and quota limits without exposing upstream response bodies.
